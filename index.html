            <p>
               Before that I was a manager at an italian restaurant in Laygley, I did that for 3 years before decided to go back to school. 
               Work and studying english allowed me to discover the world and enjoy cities like London, New York, Miami and now Vancouver.
               Those experiences taught me how to adapt fast in a new environment and work hard to acheive my goal or dead line. 
               Restaurant business taught how to do multi-tasking, deal fast with complex situation, to be pontual and to be a team player.

               And got a 2 years electronic diploma.
