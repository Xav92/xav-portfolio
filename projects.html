                <p>This Project was done during Software practice course. We used 2 APIs a Dictionnary API and OpenAI API using react. 
                    More than coding we perform a real project as it will have been in a company.
                    Started from planning, organizing, developing and deployment. 
                    All that learning and using Git and Github. 
                    This website aim to help people to improve their english by looking for a word and learning about it. 
                    And to be able to describe a picture that will be provided by the OpenAI.
